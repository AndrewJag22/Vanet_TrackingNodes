# Vanets Tracking Nodes for MininetWifi
Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are created by applying the principles of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) – the spontaneous creation of a wireless network of mobile devices – to the domain of vehicles.
in this project, tracking nodes are carried out to be able to circle each access point, so that the function of tracking nodes is to avoid disconnection.
